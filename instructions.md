Since perfboards are produced with ‘imperial’ hole distance (2,54 mm), the whole thing is constructed in inch, even if I’m European and think ‘metrical’. The lowest left hole of the perfboard is 0/0.

* print case
* figure out which buttons belong where and where to drill the holes for fixing the case
* drill holes für M3 screws into perfboard 
* remove corners
* solder and connect electric circuits
* assemble case
